# Task 3 Treatment Exercise - Ander Carrera

You work for a startup that sells machine learning based solutions to public institutions
and private companies. A well-known hospital has hired your startup to **build a machine
learning model that tells which treatment or “drug” should a new incoming patient
receive.**

In order to create that model, the hospital has provided you a dataset with already
treated patients. The dataset is called “Treatment.csv” and stores some useful
information of each patient, as well as the treatment (drug) each patient has received.

Your job is to create a machine learning model that best classifies a new incoming
patient.

Hints:
- The hospital will make the payment as soon as you upload a “good enough”
  jupyter notebook to Mudle.

- “Good enough” means:
    - Explain with comments very briefly what are you doing in every step of
      the notebook and why (if it is necessary). Remember that the hospital
      personnel are not ML experts and they have to understand your work.
    - Include in the notebook all the algorithms you tried, don’t leave only the
      best. In this way they can see all the work you’ve done.
    - Clearly explain the results you achieved.
